    <legend align="center">INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE</legend>
    At Tecxpert Infotech the quality team works very closely with the development team so that the bugs and defects can be identified at earlier stages of development. The bases for the Quality testing are SDLC/TESTING guidelines and customer Requirement documents. <br>

Every engineer follows the guideline very strictly and required to refer and record checklists, Test cases, Code reviews and observations on Testing & Review Sheet. These review sheets are again checked by Project Managers on weekly/monthly bases to form a very strong Quality Foundation.

    <legend align="center">GOALS AND BENEFITS</legend>
    The primary function of software testing is to detect bugs and defects in order to correct and uncover it. The scope of software testing includes execution of that code in various environments and also to examine the aspects of code – does the software do what it is supposed to do and function according to the specifications? <br>

At Tecxpert Infotech testing is started from the initial stages of the software development till the release stage. This not only helps in rectifying tremendous errors before the last stage, but also reduces the rework of finding the bugs in the initial stages every now and then. It also saves the cost of the defect required to find it.

    <legend align="center">QABASELINE</legend>
    The QA engineers follow some controlled procedural way through which they judge if he covered all the points required for testing or missed out any. <br>

To help testers to carry out these day-to-day activities, a baseline has to be set, which is done in the form of checklists and a Quality Assurance and testing plan for the project which defines the boundaries And scope.

    <legend align="center">TESTING PROCESS</legend>
    To make our product more reliable we follow the process based development methodologies and stringent quality processes. These Testing processes are being dynamic and take final shape as per the internal defined process: <br>

The Functional testing is performed at three stages i.e. Quality Team, Process Specialist and by Implementation Team. The Software should pass all these stages where customer requirement are kept in view while testing and validating the Final application. <br>

We all here in Tecxpert Infotech ensure that the application should conform to explicitly stated user’s external characteristics, explicitly documented quality standards and implicit characteristics. <br>
